# Gene-Expression-and-Epigenetics-Analysis-of-Pediatric-High-Grade-Gliomas

## Introduction
Pediatric high-grade gliomas (pHGGs) are a leading cause of pediatric cancer death. Unlike the adult HGGs, there are no effective therapeutic intervention or treatment exists for this sort of cancers. Although the adult and pediatric HGGs are histologically similar, they are clinically, biologically, and molecularly distinct. And Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG), the untreatable, heterogeneous pHGG of the brainstem, is a highly aggressive cancer affects mostly young children and is uniformly fatal, which needs specific treatment approaches.  
An important discovery on the molecular principles of pHGGs reveals that more than a third of patients harbor somatic mutations in H3F3A, the gene encoding the histone variant H3.3. There are two amino acid substitutions in H3.3 exiting in this gene 1) Mutation of Lysine 27 to methionine; 2) mutation of glycine 34 to arginine(G34R) or valine(G34V). So, identification of the epigenetic features and gene expressional profiles of different subgroups of pHGGs by the mutation types of Histone H3 will provide important information on targeted therapy.    
For more details and R code about this study, please look at the [report](https://github.com/sarahzhao21/Gene-Expression-and-Epigenetics-Analysis-of-Pediatric-Gliomas-Bioinformatics-Analysis-by-R/blob/948500d9f2d533af4e2eb69d02afe61ed4ec2a82/Gene_Expression_Epigenetics_Analysis_pHGGs%20(Sarah%20Zhao%208.14.2020).pdf) and the contents in this repository. 

## Data Resource
Most of the datasets were obtained from TCGA, PedCBioPortal, Xena, NCBI GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus) and some supplemental data from PubMed.  
Main datasets: GSE26576, GSE50021, GSE19578, GSE34824, GSE36245, GSE50022, GSE36278, GSE55712 E-TABM-857, E-TABM-1107. The main datasets were downloaded from National Center for Biotechnology Information [Gene Expression Omnibus](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/)

## Summary of Results
### Molecular subgroups of pHGGs and the anatomical location, age at diagnosis and overall survival
Based on the boxplot of different types of Histone H3 mutants, wildtype Histone H3 tumors were distributed mainly in hemisphere and a small population were in brain stem and midline; H3.3G34R/V tumors were almost located to the cerebral hemisphere; and H3.1/H3.3K27M were predominantly restricted in brainstem and midline. The average age at diagnosis of H3.1/H3.3K27M mutant are obviously lower than H3.3G34R/V mutant, and represents the younger age group. However, there were not significant difference of overall survival among these H3 mutation subgroups.

### Methylation-based Alterations in H3.3K27M mutant of DIPG
In DIPG patients H3.3K27M mutations occur in 65% of patients and tumors localize throughout the midline and pons, so it is necessary to specifically analyze the DNA methylation status in H3.3K27M mutations. The main datasets come from GSE36278 and GSE55712, and only the types of H3.3K27M and WT are kept in this study.  
The methylation status difference analysis has been done by “champ” method on the two groups, and these two datasets reveal quite consistent results. The scale heatmaps show that the probes can be separated into two clusters for each group, methylation increased, and methylation decreased clusters. The H3.3K27M and WT groups have quite different methylation levels for each cluster. And generally, the entire methylation levels in H3.3K27M groups are higher than the WT group.

### Gene expressional alterations in pHGGs (mRNA Microarray)
GO analysis explored the upregulated and downregulated genes in H3.3K27M mutant samples. There are multiple upregulated signaling pathways involved in neuron development and synapse transmission, including synapse organization, axonogenesis, regulation of neuron projection development, modulation of chemical synaptic transmission, regulation of trans-synaptic signaling, synapse assembly, etc.  
The down-regulated signaling pathways mainly include neutrophil related factors, such as neutrophil activation involved in immune response, neutrophil degranulation and neutrophil mediated immunity, as well as mitochondria related signal such as mitochondrial protein complex, mitochondrial matrix and mitochondrial gene expression.
